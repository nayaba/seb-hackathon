Welcome to the official page for the **General Assembly SEB Hackathon**, hosted by the talented students of the **Software Engineering Part-Time Bootcamp** in Bahrain. This event showcased creativity, determination, and technical skills as students built browser-based games using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## About the Hackathon

Over the course of two days (plus a weekend for additional development), our students tackled the exciting challenge of creating functional and engaging browser games. Participants had the option to build one or both of the following:

1. **Tamagotchi Game**  
   A virtual pet simulation where players must manage their pet's needs by playing, feeding, and putting it to sleep. Students were encouraged to add creative touches, like custom sprites and dynamic game states.

2. **Tic Tac Toe Game**  
   A two-player classic with a focus on responsive UI and logical game mechanics. Students could level up their games with features like score tracking, AI opponents, or custom themes.

Students who rose to the challenge and submitted both games gained extra chances to win in our judging categories.
